# Drinking Water Database Exploration
Analyzing drinking water standards and regulations. This git repository contains code for data acquision (see [get_data subdirectory](https://github.com/natchayal/Drinking-Water-Database/tree/main/get_data)), analysis (see [analysis subdirectory](https://github.com/natchayal/Drinking-Water-Database/tree/main/analysis)), and any relevant documentation for this project (see [docs subdirectory](https://github.com/natchayal/Drinking-Water-Database/tree/main/docs)). 

## 💧 Executive Summary 💧
I spent a lot of time exploring various drinking water database available on the internet including national, state-level, and local-level databases. I evaluated resources on the relevance of the data they provided as well as how easily the data could be accessed and downloaded, a summary of which is provided below. Using a 1 to 5 water drop scale, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest, in terms of ease of access and utility of data. Ease of access ranges from 1 drop for data that is hard to access to 5 drops for data that is readily available online. In terms of utility, 1 drop denotes data with limited application, serving primarily as reference material like MCL values or enforcement dates, while 5 drops indicate data of high utility, suitable for conducting extensive analyses and answering research questions. 

I also generated a number of R scripts, provided as interactive R markdown notebooks (.Rmd) files that demonstrate how some of these datasets are accessed and visualized. 

While this represents a number of useful sites, it's certainly not exhaustive. 

Note: The EPA ECHO database has a lot of data which makes it easy to get lost. Recommend pre-processing data as follow to allow stitching of multiple databases: (1) use  *Program Links (FRS_PROGRAM_LINKS.csv) downloaded* from [Facility Registry Service (FRS) Download](https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads#FRS) to get matching PGM_SYS_ID for PWSID with PGM_SYS_ID and get its matching REGISTRY_ID and FAC. PGM_SYS_ACRNM == SFDW and PGM_SYS_ID == PWSID for SDWIS data. Then use PWSID and/or FIPS to merge with other databases.

## [Overview of Regulatory Development Processes](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/sdwa-evaluation-and-rulemaking-process)
![](images/flowsheet_sdwa_regulatory_process.png)

The [Contaminant Candidate List (CCL)](#f-usepa-contaminant-candidate-list-ccl) is the starting point of EPA's regulatory development process. Every 5 years, EPA is required by the [Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-04/documents/epa816f04030.pdf) to publish a new list of CCL to determine which unregulated contaminants to monitor for under EPA's [Unregulated Monitoring Program (UCMR)](#e-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule-ucmr). UCMRs are limited to no more than 30 contaminants (every five years), and the monitoring is required for all large public water systems (PWSs) that serve more than 10,000 people, all small PWSs serving between 3,300 and 10,000 people, and a representative sample of small PWSs serving fewer than 3,300 people. 

UCMR data are then used to make regulatory determinations of whether to develop a [National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPWDR)](#drinking-water-regulations) for a contaminant. The SDWA requires EPA to make regulatory determinations for at least five contaminants on the CCL. During the final round of decisions which evaluates the final CCL list and UCMR results, EPA can decide to regulate or not to regulate the contaminants from the final CCL list. SDWA specifies three criteria that must be met in order for the development of a national regulation (1. Contaminant has adverse health effects on people, 2. Contaminant known to occur/substantial likelihood to occur in a PWS at frequency and level of concern, 3. Regulation of contaminant presents meaningful opportunity to reduce health risks for populations served by public water). There can be delays if additional data needs to be considered to decide whether the contaminant satisfies all three criteria, and note that the third criteria is at the sole judgement of the Administrator, the interpretation of the words in criteria can influence what action is taken. 

Once the EPA has made the determination to issue a NPWDR, EPA has 24 months to develop a proposed regulation. After the proposal date, EPA has 18 months to finalize the regulation and can request an extension to that deadline if needed. Selecting the appropriate [Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)](#setting-an-mcl-and-mclg) can be complicated and involves evaluating several science and policy options. EPA must consult with its Science Advisory Board (SAB) and the National Drinking Water Avisory Council (NDWAC). EPA may also conduct a "negotiated rulemaking" with stakeholders under the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). As part of the RegDet process, many organizations submit public comments such as water systems and their respective associations, state regulators (including ASDWA, AWWA, etc.), environmental advocacy groups, public interest groups, local elected officials and individual members of the public. Opportunities in the process for public input and comment are marked with a person icon. 

In a separate but related regulatory effort, EPA reviews all existing regulations every six years ([Six-Year Review](#c-usepa-six-year-review-syr)) for evaluation of new data to assess whether a regulation needs to be revised. 

Summary adapted from [asdwa.org](https://www.asdwa.org/sdwa-regulatory-development-process/), which gives a pretty good summary of the processes.

## [Setting an MCL and MCLG](https://www.epa.gov/iris/reference-dose-rfd-description-and-use-health-risk-assessments)
![](images/regulation_mclg_development.png)

Reference Dose (RfD) is based on the human equivalent dose (HED) of where there's either no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or low observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). It is buffered by an uncertainty factor (UF) which adjusts for the interspecies, intraspecies, and/or other variabilty (e.g. from mice to humans). The RfD is then modified by body weight and the ingestion (BW/I) ratio to calculate the drinking water equivalent level (DWEL). A reduced BW/I ratio lowers the range of possible lifetime health advisory (Lifetime HA) given a range of relative source contribution (RSC) values. It is important to note that EPA uses 0.2 (20%) as a default RSC. The lowest RSC is 20% based on the assumption that chemicals with exposures less than 20% of the total will not provide a meaningful opportunity to reduce risk for the population. 80% is the highest available RSC based on the assumption that there may be minor sources not captured by the data. RSC values are typically bounded by 20% floor and 80% ceiling. 

RSC of 0.2 is saying that 20% of your contribution to this contaminant comes from drinking water. *Something to think about: If DWEL is 1 and RSC is 1 (100%), then your MCLG would be 1. If your DWEL was 1 and the RSC was 0.2 (20%), your MCLG would be 0.2ng/L*. This means, the lower the relative source contribution, the lower it drives the MCLG! A lot of people argue that this is problematic (see PFAS for example, using RSC ranging from 0.2 to 1 can drive MCLG anywhere from 70ng/L to >600ng/L, big span!). EPA uses 35 (kg/L/day), some cases uses lower BW/I ratio to protect fetuses and women. In short, Lifetime HA or MCLG, is significantly influenced by RfD, RSC and BW/I values.

There can be multiple RfD sources whose standard are set by different agencies using their toxicological databases. For example for PFOS/PFOA: ASTDR (CDC), CA (California), NJ (New Jersey), and IRIS (USEPA) are different RfD sources used by different agencies, which uses different RfD values and could result in different Lifetime HAs or MCLGs. The difference in RfDs are most likely due to the different UFs used in calculation. EPA must decide on which MCLG to use based on the best available toxicology information. MCLG is health-based only, with adequate margins of safety, does not take cost and feasibility into consideration.

Once the Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) is determined, EPA sets an enforceable standard. In most cases, the standard is an MCL. The MCL is set as close to the MCLG as feasible. Taking cost into consideration, EPA must determine the feasible MCL. This is defined by the Federal SDWA as the level that may be achieved with:
  - use of the best available technology or treatment approaches.
  - other means which EPA finds are available (after examination for efficiency under field conditions, not solely under laboratory conditions).

See [USEPA IRIS Information](#g-usepa-iris-information) and [Drinking Water Treatment Technologies](#h-drinking-water-treatment-technologies) section. <br />

## I. National Data Sources

### A. EPA Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS)

- **<u>Overview</u>**: Potential, but with obstacles; possibly redundant.
  - Violation and enforcement data are reported quarterly
  - The data are obscurely layered across different servers.
  - Possibly redundant with ECHO. 
  - Queries must be done iteratively with R. Server is often down.

- **<u>SDWIS home page</u>**: https://www.epa.gov/enviro/topic-searches#water 

- **<u>Summary</u>**: "What is the violation rate?" SDWIS tracks information on drinking water contamination levels as required by the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act and its 1986 and 1996 amendments. The site provides data on violations and enforcement history since 1993 of the EPA's drinking water regulations. 

- **<u>Data</u>**: <br />
<ins>Violation<in>:
    - By **interactive map** (EASY) - The data is available from here, in limited capacity: https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-search
    	- SDWIS Search by: 'Select a geographic area' or 'Enter the water system ID number' (PWSID for tribal agencies will have region code instead of state code as prefix)
    - By using the **SDWIS Federal Reports Advanced Search tool** (BETTER) - select data of interest and export report as a .csv file, use this link: https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/sfdw/f?p=108:1:0::NO:1 ; data only goes back 10 years; to get older records use R to scrape, see below.
    	- A full description of violation and contaminant codes can be accessed in the SDWA_REF_CODE_VALUES.csv of https://echo.epa.gov/files/echodownloads/SDWA_latest_downloads.zip ECHO site.
    
    - By using **R to scrape data** (BEST!) - R script is based on the info contained here: https://www.epa.gov/enviro/web-services and https://www.epa.gov/enviro/envirofacts-data-service-api
      - Then need to scrape sub-tables, refer to: https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/metadata/search and https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/metadata/model.
      - Limitations: The output may be limited to 10000 rows of data at a time, sometimes can get away scraping more, but a user can pick which 10000 rows of data and then return to retrieve the next 10000. 
      - If you need to define a code or other parameter in the table, this link contains all that information: https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/ef_metadata_html.ef_metadata_table?p_table_name=VIOLATION&p_topic=SDWIS
- <u>Code examples</u> : 
```r
	library(readr)

	Data1 <- read_csv(url("https://data.epa.gov/efservice/VIOLATION/ROWS/0:10000/CSV")) 
	Data2 <- read_csv(url("https://data.epa.gov/efservice/VIOLATION/ROWS/10000:20000/CSV")) 
	Data3 <- read_csv(url("https://data.epa.gov/efservice/VIOLATION/ROWS/20000:30000/CSV")) 
	Data4 <- read_csv(url("https://data.epa.gov/efservice/VIOLATION/ROWS/30000:40000/CSV")) 
	Data5 <- read_csv(url("https://data.epa.gov/efservice/VIOLATION/ROWS/40000:50000/CSV"))
	
	DataMerged_meta <- do.call("rbind", list(Data1,Data2,Data3,Data4,Data5))
	filename <- paste0("AllViolationData_EPA_EnvirofactsAPI_", format(Sys.Date(), "%m%d%y"), ".csv")
	write_csv(DataMerged_meta, file = filename)

	# Use filter or operator to select specific data to scrape, example, to only scrape Nitrate MCL violation data
	Nitrate_CWS <- read_csv(url("https://data.epa.gov/efservice/VIOLATION/pws_activity_code/A/pws_type_code/CWS/contaminant_code/1040/violation_category_code/MCL/CSV"))
```

<ins>Treatment<ins>:
- For treatment information (latest refresh, data updated quarterly), this link: https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/ef_metadata_html.ef_metadata_table?p_table_name=TREATMENT&p_topic=SDWIS

- For additional years (previous to present), data are available in the ECHO Downloads, link: https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads

- For other Envirofacts Data Service: API https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-model (How these files relate is described here)
  
- "What happens if a utility exceeds a regulatory threshold?
  - When a Public Water System (PWS) violates regulations, such as exceeding Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL), it: (1) must issue a notice within 24 hours. (2) must correct the issue. (3) risks being added by EPA to their list of serious violators. (4) could face enforcement action by EPA, financial or legal actions, if fail to resolve and system has been in noncompliance continuously for 3 years. <br/>Read more here:  https://echo.epa.gov/help/sdwa-faqs

Note: When analyzing violations, it may be more beneficial to count Public Water System (PWS) with the violation once per year, regardless of multiple quarterly violations. This method ensures a clearer understanding of yearly compliance without double-counting PWSs with multiple violations of the same contaminant due to multiple sampling. May also want to consider limiting sample to CWSs with consistent reporting over the study period and serving more than 500 people because SDWA regulations apply to small CWSs differently, especially in terms of sampling frequency. Sampling frequency could influence the likelihood of detecting a violation. For example, some DBPs only need to be sampled on an annual basis, rather than quarterly, for CWSs serving less than 500 people. Furthermore, very small systems are more likely to have inadequate reporting practices. A limitation of the SDWA violations dataset is underreporting. Check both Health-based violations (includes MCL, MRDL, TT violations) and Monitoring and reporting violatons (MR violations).

### B. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO)

- **<u>Overview</u>**: ***Promising***

  * `USWQP/USWaterData-Explore.Rmd` provides and example for ingesting and visualizing the US Water Quality Portal data scraped for California. 


### E. Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR)

- **<u>Overview</u>**: Only place to get data on unregulated contaminants
  - The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) amendments require that once every five years EPA issue a new Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) of no more than 30 unregulated contaminants to be monitored by public water systems (PWSs).
  - The UCMR program was developed in coordination with the CCL.
  - Monitors all large PWSs (>10,000), all small PWSs (3,300-10,000), and a representative sample of small PWSs (<3,300).
  - Contains disinfectant type and treatment information useful info to match by PWSID and merge with data from SDWIS and SYR. Disinfectant Residual (e.g. Free Chlorine, Chloramine) and treatment information (e.g. GAC, Ionic exchange, etc.) only available UCMR4 onwards.
  - Currently the only source known to have disinfectant type explicitly reported as a column in dataset.

- **<u>UCMR home page</u>**: https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr
  
- **<u>Summary</u>**: EPA uses the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) to collect data for contaminants suspected to be present in drinking water, but that do not have regulatory standards set under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The monitoring provides EPA and other interested parties with nationally representative data on the occurrence of contaminants in drinking water, the number of people potentially being exposed, and an estimate of the levels of that exposure. These data can support future regulatory determinations and other actions to protect public health. 
- **<u>Data</u>**:
    - Unregulated Contaminant Occurence data: https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/occurrence-data-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule
   
- <u>Code examples</u>: None

### F. USEPA Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) 
- **<u>Overview</u>**: Only place to get a list of drinking water contaminants that are not currently subject to EPA drinking water regulations but under surveillance for potential future regulation. 
  
- **<u>CCL home page</u>**: https://www.epa.gov/ccl
  
- **<u>Summary</u>**: EPA issues a new Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) every five years, serving as the first level of evaluation for unregulated drinking water contaminants if it presents a public health risk. Contaminants listed on the CCL is used to determine which contaminants to monitor for under EPA's Unregulated Monitoring Program (UCMR) and may require future regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The SDWA requires EPA to periodically decide whether or not to regulate at least five contaminants on the Contaminant Candidate List during the 'Regulatory Determination' phase. A regulatory determination is a formal decision on whether EPA should initiate a process to develop a national primary drinking water regulation (NPDWR) for a specific contaminant based on the final CCL and UCMR monitoring results. The RegDet process involves determining whether a contaminant may have adverse health effects, whether a contaminant is found or substantially likely to be found in PWS with a frequency and at levels of concern, and whther there is a meaningful opportnity for health risk reduction through a national drinking water regulation.
  - Developed in coordination with the UCMR.

### G. USEPA IRIS Information

- **<u>Overview</u>**: Good for toxicity information

- **<u>IRIS home page</u>**:  https://www.epa.gov/iris
  
- **<u>Summary</u>**: "What is the toxicity?" The Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database contains the toxicology data used in setting the MCL. IRIS assessments provide the toxicity values for health effects resulting from chronic exposure to chemicals. These values include the oral reference dose (RfD) and other data used to assess the chemical. EPA's risk management decision is a function of the MCL, which in turn is based upon IRIS data.

### Drinking Water Regulations
* <u>Overview of the Safe Drinking Water Act</u>: https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/overview-safe-drinking-water-act
* <u>How EPA Regulates Drinking Water Contaminants</u>: https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/how-epa-regulates-drinking-water-contaminants 
* <u>National Primary Drinking Water Regulation Table</u>: https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulation-table (a table of drinking water MCLs)

**<u>SDWA Rules and enforcement dates</u>**: contains drinking water rule pages which states the enforcement dates of each rule grouped by contaminant type. 
- **<u>Summary</u>**: The EPA regulates over 90 contaminants in drinking water, setting limits to protect health and ensure water systems can comply using current technology. The Safe Drinking Water Act allows states to enforce their own standards, provided they are as strict as the EPA's.
    - <u>NPDWR Groundwater and Drinking Water Regulations</u>: https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations 
    - <u>Regulation Timeline under the SDWA</u>: https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/regulation-timeline-contaminants-regulated-under-safe-drinking-water-act <br />
        - Some SDWA rule names and enforcement dates: Arsenic, Arsenic Rule (2006); GWR, Ground Water Rule (2009); IESW, Interim Enhanced SurfaceWater Treatment Rule(2002); LCR, Lead and Copper Rule (1992); LT1ESW, Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (2005); NIPDWR, National Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulations (1977); Phase I Rule (1989); Phase II Rule (1992); PhaseV Rule (1994); Radionuclides, Radionuclides Rule (2003); RLCR, Revised Lead and Copper Rule (2007); RTCR, Revised Total Coliform Rule (2016); Stage 1 DBPs, Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection By-productsRule (2002–2004); Stage 2 DBPs, Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection By-products Rule (2012–2013); SWTR, Surface Water Treatment Rule (1993); TCR, Total Coliform Rule (1990); and Trihalomethanes, Total Trihalomethanes (1981–1983).
    - *Two* important dates to note: When the EPA adopts a new standard for contaminants in drinking water, such as reducing the arsenic MCL from 50 ppb to 10 ppb on January 22, 2001, it also sets a compliance deadline for water utilities, which, in this case, was January 23, 2006. This gives utilities time to adjust their systems to meet the new requirements. When performing timeseries analysis, must decide on which of the two dates to use.
   - Every five years EPA reviews the list of contaminants, largely based on the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL), then list and collect monitoring data for up to 30 contaminants (UCMR), then determine whether at least five need a drinking water standard (Regulatory Determinations), if yes, then develop or revise the drinking water standard (Regulation Devlopment), then collect Six-Year Review data review and decide whether to revise the standard (SYR).

### Type of Sampling Point
**<u>Type of Sampling Point</u>**: indicates the location or function of the sampling point. Type could be one of the following:
- **DS**: Distribution System—the location is in the distribution system of the water system. Examples of this type of sampling point include sampling points for Total Coliform, lead and copper, and perhaps disinfection by-products (see several of the types below for more precise ways to define disinfection by-products sampling points).
- **EP**: Entry Point—location at which water enters the distribution system of a public water system. This is intended to correspond to the regulatory definition of an entry point to the distribution system representative of one or more sources of water. These should not be associated to Distribution System facilities but rather to the facility from which the water is flowing (e.g., a treatment plant, a well (if not treated prior to distribution), a common header).
- **FC**: The first customer after the entry point into the distribution system.  While this site is specifically needed for chlorite and chlorine dioxide distribution system samples, it may have other uses.
- **LD**: Lowest Disinfectant Residual—the location where the disinfectant residual is the lowest. This type of sampling point comes directly out of the Revisions to the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule dated September 17, 1999, where the preamble explains, “Some public commentators suggested that sampling for microbiological contaminants not occur at the maximum residence time in the distribution system, but at the point of lowest disinfectant residual, since the monitoring of concern is for effectiveness of treatment and booster disinfection stations that may be in use in long distribution lines. In response, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency added another sampling point at the ‘‘lowest disinfectant residual’’ in the distribution system.” for trihalomethane (Disinfection By-Products Rule) and/or Total Coliform sampling.
- **MD**: Midpoint in the Distribution System—the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule location at which the chlorine residual would be expected to be typical for the system. This could also be used to designate those sampling points that are considered “representative points in the distribution system” under the Disinfection By-Products Rules.
- **MR**: Point of Maximum Retention—the location that represents the maximum residence time of disinfectants within the distribution system under the Disinfection By-Products Rules. This can also be used as the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule location in the distribution system that is furthest from the entry point to the distribution.
- **PC**: Process Control—locations normally associated with treatment plants or storage water system facilities. This sampling point type is used to demonstrate compliance with contact time or other disinfectant or treatment requirements.
- **RW**: Raw Water Source—locations normally associated with intake or well water system facilities. Raw water monitoring is triggered by the detection of a contaminant at an entry point to the distribution system. This Sampling Point type can also be used to designate the raw water sampling point for precursor removal.
- **SR**: Source Water Point—defined in the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule as the location at which untreated water is collected at the source.
- **UP**: Unit Process—a sampling point used to evaluate the effectiveness of a unit process. This type might be used, for instance, to determine the contact time under the Surface Water Treatment Rule for a single unit process.
- **WS**: Water System Facility point. <br />

### Classifications
A **public water system (PWS)** must provides water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed conveyances to at least have at least 15 service connections or serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year. It can be publicly or privately owned.

EPA has defined three types of [public water systems](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/information-about-public-water-systems):
* **<u>_Community Water System_ (CWS)</u>**: A public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round.
* **<u>_Non-Transient Non-Community Water System_ (NTNCWS)</u>**: A public water system that regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six months per year. Some examples are schools, factories, office buildings, and hospitals which have their own water systems.
* **<u>_Transient Non-Community Water System_ (TNCWS)</u>**: A public water system that provides water in a place such as a gas station or campground where people do not remain for long periods of time.

There are over 148,000 public water systems in the United States.

### Size category (based on people served by the system)
**<u>Size category</u>** (based on people served by the system)
* 1 = Very Small <=500
* 2 = Small 501-3,300
* 3 = Medium 3,301-10,000
* 4 = Large 10,001-100,000
* 5 = Very large >100,000

### US EPA Regional Offices
- **<u>Summary</u>**: EPA has ten Regional offices, each responsible for execution of their programs within several states and territories.
